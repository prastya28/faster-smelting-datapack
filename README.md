## Faster Smelting Datapack for Minecraft 1.14.x, 1.15.x, 1.16.x

I hate waiting! This is just a very simple datapack for Minecraft Java Edition to speed up smelting time.

Smelting with furnace, blast furnace, and smoker only takes 1ms (originally 200ms with furnace and 100ms with blast furnace and smoker) per item.
Cooking on a campfire takes 100ms (originally it takes 600ms).

Quite an upgrade, isn't it?

You can modify the speed by editing the "cookingtime" integer element inside the JSON file.

Currently, not all possible items are added.

[**UPDATE - 06/23/2020**] Tested and works on **Minecraft 1.16**
